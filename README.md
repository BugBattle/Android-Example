The easiest way to integrate BugBattle into your apps is by using the BugBattle Android SDK! This article explains the basic steps to integrate this library to your personal project. ðŸ˜ƒ

## Add BugBattle 
Open your app in your preferred  development tool, for e.g. Android Studio.

**Add the dependency**

In the same file ( build.gradle ) add the dependency to include the library. 
```
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'io.bugbattle:Bugbattle-Android-SDK:3.3.9'
}
```
( don't forget to synchronise your includes ðŸ˜„)

By adding this, you are ready to use the library in your app. Let's carry on with the initialisation ðŸŽ‰


**Initialise the SDK**

Open your preferred development tool and add the following to your main class.

```
import bugbattle.io.bugbattle.BugBattle;  
import bugbattle.io.bugbattle.BugBattleActivationMethod; 
```
This two includes are everything you need.
```
@Override      
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {          
    .... 
    BugBattle.initialise("apikey", BugBattleActivationMethod.SHAKE, this);     
} 
```
Add the initialise method to your main activity . Your API key can be found in the project settings within BugBattle. The second parameter is, how the bug report flow is started. There are several activation methodes:
```
BugBattleActivationMethod.SHAKE // Shake the phone to activate

BugBattleActivationMethod.NONE // disable gesture

BugBattleActivationMethod.THREE_FINGER_DOUBLE_TAB // double tap with three fingers to activate

BugBattleActivationMethod.SCREENSHOT // open bugbattle on physically create screenshot

```
The following method starts the flow, which is also invoked by the shake gesture. To start the flow use this method:
```
BugBattle.startBugReporting()
```
Now you are ready to go ðŸ˜„

**Language**

Sets the default language of the BugBattle reporting flow. Overrides the system default language. The parameter is formatted as Alpha-2 code.
